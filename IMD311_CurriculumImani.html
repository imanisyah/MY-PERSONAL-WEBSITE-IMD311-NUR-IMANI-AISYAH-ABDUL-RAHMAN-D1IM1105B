	<h1 style="text-align: center;">CURRICULUM</h1>

	<p>I was actively involved in the curriculum as a part of Commander Bulan Sabit Merah Malaysia in UiTM Machang.</p>

	<p>While all students study through ODL (Online Distance Learning) at home, I entered UiTM Machang during the third semester of lectures in 2021. Commanders are required to enter college to do various activities together but still practice social distancing to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The advantage of being a commander is being granted a college exemption. The picture below is a picture of when my friend and I were still juniors.</p>

	<p>When our seniors have become alumni, we take their place as seniors. Now, we only have 8 people left to continue this association successfully. Although the value of our members is small, we are able to run several programs in UiTM as a result of each other's cooperation.</p>

	<p>Regarding the previous and current semesters, there's a lot of activity we have done in and out of university. Among them are the Blood Donation Program, CPR Talk with SUKSIS, Basic First Aid Briefing Program, and others.</p>
